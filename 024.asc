// 4625
//Draco waited in a small windowed alcove he’d found near the Great Hall, stomach
//churning.
// ! stomach churning
Драко чекав у невеличкій ніші з вікнами, що він знайшов був поряд з Великою Залою.
Його нудило.

// 4626
//There would be a price, and it would not be small. Draco had known that as soon
//as he’d woken up and realized that he didn’t dare enter the Great Hall for
//breakfast because he might see Harry Potter there and Draco didn’t know what
//would happen after that.
Буде розплата, і вона буде чималою. Драко це знав був, відколи прокинувся й зрозумів,
що не наважиться зайти до Великої Зали на сніданок, бо може побачити там Гаррі Поттера,
і Драко гадки не мав, що буде далі.

// 4627
//Footsteps approached.
Наблизилися кроки.

// 4628
//“Here ya go,” said Vincent’s voice. “Now da boss ain’t in a good mood today, so
//ya’d better watch your step.”
-- Ось тута, -- пролунав голос Вінсента. -- Слухай, в боса настрій кепський
сьогодні, то краще будь обережним.

// 4629
//Draco was going to skin that idiot alive and send back the flayed body with a
//request for a more intelligent servant, like a dead gerbil.
Драко збирався живцем здерти шкуру з цього недоумка й відіслати очищену тушу із
запитом на більш розумного слугу, наприклад, дохлого щура.

// 4630
//One set of footsteps went off, and the other set of footsteps came closer.
Кроки однієї людини пішли геть, а іншої наблизилися.

// 4631
//The churning in Draco’s stomach got worse.
Нудота Драко посилилася.

// 4632
//Harry Potter came into sight. His face was carefully neutral, but his
//blue-trimmed robes looked oddly askew, as if they hadn’t been put on quite
//right -
Він побачив Гаррі Поттера. Той мав дуже нейтральне обличчя, проте оздоблена
синім мантія була якоюсь кривою, ніби він надягнув був її неправильно...

// 4633
//“__Your hand,__” Draco said without thinking about it at all.
-- __Твоя рука,__ -- бездумно бовкнув Драко.

// 4634
//Harry raised his left arm, as though to look at it himself.
Гаррі підняв лівицю, ніби йому самому було цікаво.

// 4635
//The hand dangled limply from it, like something dead.
Кисть безвольно хиталася, ніби була мертвою.

// 4636
//“Madam Pomfrey said it’s not permanent,” Harry said quietly. “She said it
//should mostly recover by the time classes start tomorrow.”
-- Мадам Помфрі сказала, що це не назавжди, -- тихо сказав Гаррі. -- Вона
сказала, що рука має повністю одужати перед початком завтрашніх занять.

// 4637
//For a single instant the news came as a relief.
На мить він сприйняв ці новини з полегшенням.

// 4638
//And then Draco realized.
А потім Драко зрозумів.

// 4639
//“You went to Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Draco.
-- Ти пішов до мадам Помфрі, -- прошепотів Драко.

// 4640
//“Of course I did,” said Harry Potter, as though stating the obvious. “My hand
//wasn’t working.”
-- Звісно пішов, -- сказав Гаррі Поттер, ніби стверджував очевидне. -- У мене ж
рука не працювала.

// 4641
//It was slowly dawning on Draco what an __absolute__ fool he’d been, far
//worse than the older Slytherins he’d chewed out.
// ! chewed out
Драко повільно усвідомлював, наскільки __повним__ дурнем він був -- набагато
гіршим, ніж старші слизеринці, що він з них кепкував був.

// 4642
//He’d just taken for granted that no one would go to the authorities when a
//Malfoy did something to them. That no one would want Lucius Malfoy’s eye on
//them, ever.
Він просто вважав безсумнівним, що ніхто не звертатиметься до професорів, коли
Мелфой з ними щось зробить. Що ніхто не захоче привертати до себе пильну увагу
Луціуса Мелфоя за жодних обставин.

// 4643
//But Harry Potter wasn’t a frightened little Hufflepuff trying to stay out of
//the game. He was already playing it, and Father’s eye was already on him.
Проте Гаррі Поттер не був маленьким заляканим гафелпафцем, що старався
триматися подалі від гри. Він вже грав у неї й уже привернув увагу батька.

// 4644
//“What else did Madam Pomfrey say?” said Draco, his heart in his throat.
// ! his heart in his throat
-- Що ще сказала мадам Помфрі? -- запитав Драко, його душа сховалася в пʼяти.

// 4645
//“Professor Flitwick said that the spell cast on my hand had been a Dark torture
//hex and extremely serious business, and that refusing to say who did it was
//absolutely unacceptable.”
-- Професор Флитвік сказав, що закляття, що його застосували до моєї руки, було
темним прокльоном катування -- вкрай серйозна справа, і що моя відмова назвати
винного була абсолютно неприйнятною.

// 4646
//There was a long pause.
Запала довга тиша.

// 4647
//“And then?” Draco said in a shaking voice.
-- А потім? -- запитав Драко з тремтінням у голосі.

// 4648
//Harry Potter smiled slightly. “I apologized deeply, which made Professor
//Flitwick look __very__ stern, and then I told Professor Flitwick that the
//whole thing was, indeed, extremely serious, secret, __delicate __business,
//and that I’d already informed the Headmaster about the project.”
Гаррі Поттер ледь усміхнувся.

-- Я глибоко вибачився, через що професор Флитвік __вкрай__ спохмурнів, і
сказав професорові Флитвіку, що все це було, і справді, дуже серйозною,
таємною, __тонкою__ справою, і що я вже проінформував директора про цей проект.

// 4649
//Draco gasped. “No! Flitwick isn’t going to just accept that! He’ll check with
//Dumbledore!”
Драко скрикнув.

-- Ні! Флитвік не проковтне це просто так! Він запитає Дамблдора!

// 4650
//“Indeed,” said Harry Potter. “I was promptly hauled off to the Headmaster’s
//office.”
-- І справді, -- сказав Гаррі Поттер. -- Мене негайно привели до кабінету
директора.

// 4651
//Draco was trembling now. If Dumbledore brought Harry Potter before the
//Wizengamot, willingly or otherwise, and had the Boy-Who-Lived testify under
//Veritaserum that Draco had tortured him… too many people loved Harry Potter,
//Father could __lose__ that vote…
Тепер Драко тремтів. Якщо Дамблдор приведе Гаррі Поттера до чарверсуду,
добровільно чи ні, і змусить Хлопчика-Що-Вижив засвідчити під сироваткою
правди, що Драко катував був його... Надто багато хто любив Гаррі Поттера,
батько міг __програти__ це голосування...

// 4652
//Father might be able to convince Dumbledore not to do that, but it would
//__cost.__ Cost terribly. The game had rules now, you couldn’t just
//threaten someone at random any more. But Draco had walked into Dumbledore’s
//hands of his own free will. And Draco was a very valuable hostage.
Батько може переконати Дамблдора не робити цього, проте не __задарма__. Зовсім
не задарма. Тепер у гри були правила, більше не можна було погрожувати кому
завгодно. Але Драко потрапив був до рук Дамблдора з власної волі. А Драко був
дуже цінним заручником.

// 4653
//Though since Draco couldn’t be a Death Eater now, he wasn’t as valuable as
//Father thought.
Хоча тепер Драко не міг стати смертежером, і був не настільки цінним, як гадав
батько.

// 4654
//The thought tore at his heart like a Cutting Charm.
Ця думка ранила його серце мов різальні чари.

// 4655
//“Then what?” whispered Draco.
-- І що далі? -- прошепотів Драко.

// 4656
//“Dumbledore deduced immediately that it was you. He knew we’d been
//associating.”
-- Дамблдор миттєво зробив висновок, що це ти. Він знав, що ми спілкувалися.

// 4657
//The worst possible scenario. If Dumbledore hadn’t guessed who did it, he might
//not have risked using Legilimency just to find out… but if Dumbledore
//__knew…__
Найгірший з можливих сценаріїв. Якби Дамблдор не здогадався був, хто винен, то,
можливо, не ризикнув би скористатися виманологією лише щоб зʼясувати... Але якщо
Дамблдор __знав__...


// 4658
//“And?” Draco forced out the word.
-- І? -- вичавив з себе Драко.

// 4659
//“We had a little chat.”
-- Ми трохи побалакали.

// 4660
//“And?”
-- І?

// 4661
//Harry Potter grinned. “And I explained that it would be in his best interest
//not to do anything.”
Гаррі Поттер вишкірився.

-- І я пояснив йому, що в його ж інтересах нічого не робити.

// 4662
//Draco’s mind ran into a brick wall and splattered. He just stared at Harry
//Potter with his mouth hanging slack like a fool.
Розум Драко зіткнувся з цегляною стіною й розтікся по ній. Він просто
витріщався на Гаррі Поттера й широко роззявив рота, ніби дурень.

// 4663
//It took that long for Draco to remember.
Аж так довго Драко згадував.

// 4664
//Harry knew Dumbledore’s mysterious secret, the one Snape used as his hold.
Гаррі знав таємничий секрет Дамблдора, завдяки якому Снейп контролював його.

// 4665
//Draco could just see it now. Dumbledore looking all stern, concealing his
//eagerness as he explained to Harry what a terribly serious matter this was.
Тепер Драко ясно собі це уявляв. Дуже суворий Дамблдор, що приховує свою жагу,
доки пояснює Гаррі, яка це страшенно серйозна справа.

// 4666
//And Harry politely telling Dumbledore to keep his mouth shut if he knew what
//was good for him.
// ! if he knew what was good for him
І Гаррі, що ввічливо каже Дамблдорові тримати язика за зубами заради свого ж
блага.

// 4667
//Father had warned Draco against people like this, people who could ruin you and
//still be so likable that it was hard to hate them properly.
Тато попереджав був його про таких людей: людей, що могли зруйнувати твоє життя
й все одно так подобатися, що їх складно належним чином ненавидіти.

// 4668
//“After which,” Harry said, “the Headmaster told Professor Flitwick that this
//was, indeed, a secret and delicate matter of which he had already been
//informed, and that he did not think pressing it at this time would help me or
//anyone. Professor Flitwick started to say something about the Headmaster’s
//usual plotting going much too far, and I had to interrupt at that point and
//explain that it had been my __own__ idea and not anything the Headmaster
//forced me into, so Professor Flitwick spun around and started lecturing
//__me__, and the Headmaster interrupted __him__ and said that as the
//Boy-Who-Lived I was doomed to have weird and dangerous adventures so I was
//safer if I got into them on purpose instead of waiting for them to happen by
//accident, and that was when Professor Flitwick threw up his little hands and
//started shrieking in a high-pitched voice at __both__ of us about how he
//didn’t care what we were cooking up together, but this wasn’t ever to happen
//again for as long as I was in Ravenclaw House or he would have me thrown out
//and I could go to Gryffindor which was where all this __Dumbledoring__
//belonged -”
-- Після чого, -- сказав Гаррі, -- директор сказав професорові Флитвіку, що
це й справді таємниця та тонка історія, про яку його вже проінформували були,
і що він вважав, що негайне розвʼязання цього питання не допомогло б ані мені,
ані будь-кому іншому. Професор Флитвік почав казати щось про те, що хитрі плани
директора вже перетнули межу, і тоді я перервав його й пояснив, що це була моя
__власна__ ідея, а не щось, до чого мене примусив директор, тоді професор Флитвік
крутнувся на місці й почав читати лекцію __мені__, тоді директор перервав __його__
й сказав, що я, як Хлопчик-Що-Вижив, приречений до дивних і небезпечних пригод, і
буде лише безпечніше, якщо я втраплятиму в них навмисно, а не чекатиму, доки вони
трапляться випадково, а тоді професор Флитвік розвів руками й почав верещати своїм
високим голосом на нас __обох__ про те, що йому начхати, яку кашу ми заварили разом,
але такого більше не трапиться, доки я в гуртожитку Рейвенклов, або він мене викине
з нього і я зможу піти до Ґрифіндору, де й місце всій цій __дамблдорщині__...

// 4669
//Harry was making it __very__ hard for Draco to hate him.
Гаррі __дуже__ заважав Драко ненавидіти його.

// 4670
//“Anyway,” Harry said, “I didn’t want to be thrown out of Ravenclaw, so I
//promised Professor Flitwick that nothing like this would happen again, and if
//it did, I would just tell him who did it.”
-- Хай там як, -- сказав Гаррі, -- я б не хотів, щоб мене викинули з
Рейвенклову, отже я пообіцяв професорові Флитвіку, що нічого подібного більше
не станеться, а як станеться, то я просто скажу йому, хто це зробив.

// 4671
//Harry’s eyes should have been cold. They weren’t. The voice should have made it
//a deadly threat. It wasn’t.
Очі Гаррі мали б бути холодними. Та не були. Його голос мав би звучати, як
смертельна погроза. Та не звучав.

// 4672
//And Draco saw the question that should have been obvious, and it killed the
//mood in an instant.
І Драко спало на думку питання, що мало б бути очевидним, і воно одразу звело
нанівець його настрій.

// 4673
//“Why… didn’t you?”
-- Чому... ти не сказав?

// 4674
//Harry walked over to the window, into the small beam of sunlight shining into
//the alcove, and turned his head outward, toward the green grounds of Hogwarts.
//The brightness shone on him, on his robes, on his face.
Гаррі підійшов до вікна, під сонячне проміння, що проникало до ніші, і поглянув
назовні, до зелених земель Гоґвортсу. Світло сяяло на ньому, його мантії, його
обличчі.

// 4675
//“Why didn’t I?” Harry said. His voice caught. “I guess because I just couldn’t
//get angry at you. I knew I’d hurt you first. I won’t even call it fair, because
//what I did to you was worse than what you did to me.”
// ! voice caught
-- Чому не сказав? -- повторив Гаррі й затнувся. -- Напевно, я просто не міг
злитися на тебе. Я знав, що завдав тобі болю першим. Я навіть не можу сказати,
що ми квити, адже те, що я зробив з тобою, набагато гірше за те, що ти зробив
зі мною.

// 4676
//It was like running into another brick wall. Harry could have been speaking
//archaic Greek for all Draco understood him then.
Драко ніби знову наштовхнувся на цегляну стіну. Якби Гаррі сказав це
древньогрецькою, Драко б зрозумів не менше.

// 4677
//Draco’s mind scrabbled for patterns and came up flat blank. The statement was a
//concession that hadn’t been in Harry’s best interests. It wasn’t even what
//Harry should say to make Draco a more loyal servant, now that Harry held power
//over him. For that Harry should be emphasizing how kindly he’d been, not how
//much he’d hurt Draco.
Розум Драко понишпорив у пошуках чогось відповідного, і повернувся ні з чим. Це
твердження було зізнанням, що не було в інтересах Гаррі. Навіть якщо Гаррі намагався
зробити Драко своїм вірним слугою, він не мав би такого казати тепер, коли мав
над ним владу. Для цього Гаррі мав наголошувати на тому, яким він був добрим, а
не на тому, якої шкоди він завдав Драко.

// 4678
//“Even so,” Harry said, and now his voice was lower, almost a whisper, “please
//don’t do that again, Draco. It hurt, and I’m not sure I could forgive you a
//second time. I’m not sure I’d be able to want to.”
-- І все одно, -- сказав Гаррі, тепер тихіше, ледь не пошепки, -- будь ласка,
не роби такого більше, Драко. Це було боляче, і я не впевнений, що зможу таке
пробачити вдруге. Я навіть не впевнений, що зможу захотіти пробачити.

// 4679
//Draco just didn’t get it.
Драко просто не міг второпати.

// 4680
//Was Harry trying to be __friends__ with him?
Гаррі що, намагався __дружити__ з ним?

// 4681
//There was no way Harry Potter could be dumb enough to believe that was still
//possible after what he’d done.
Гаррі не міг бути достатньо тупим, щоб вважати, що це досі можливо після того,
що він зробив був.

// 4682
//You could be someone’s friend and ally, like Draco had tried to do with Harry,
//or you could destroy their life and leave them no other options. Not both.
Можна було бути чиїмось другом і союзником, чого Драко й намагався досягти з
Гаррі, або можна було знищити їхнє життя й не залишити їм жодного вибору.
Робити і те, і те одночасно було не можна.

// 4683
//But then Draco didn’t understand what else Harry __could__ be trying.
Проте Драко не міг уявити, що __ще__ Гаррі міг намагатися зробити.

// 4684
//And a strange thought came to Draco then, something Harry had kept talking
//about yesterday.
І тоді дещо дивне спало на думку Драко, щось, про що Гаррі говорив був без
упину вчора.

// 4685
//And the thought was: __Test it.__
А саме: __перевір це__.

// 4686
//__You’re awakened as a scientist now,__ Harry had said, __and even
//if you never learn to use your power, you’ll always, be looking, for ways, to
//test, your beliefs…__ Those ominous words, spoken in gasps of agony, had kept
//running through Draco’s mind.

// 4687
//If Harry __was__ pretending to be the repentant friend who had
//accidentally hurt someone…

// 4688
//“You __planned__ what you did to me!” Draco said, managing to put a note
//of accusation in his voice. “You didn’t do it because you got angry, you did it
//because you __wanted__ to!”

// 4689
//__Fool,__ Harry Potter would say, __of course I planned it, and now
//you’re mine -__

// 4690
//Harry turned back toward Draco. “What happened yesterday __wasn’t__ the
//plan,” Harry said, his voice seeming stuck in his throat. “The __plan__
//was that I would teach you why you were always better off knowing the truth,
//and then we would try together to discover the truth about blood, and whatever
//the answer was we would accept it. Yesterday I… rushed things.”

// 4691
//“Always better off knowing the truth,” Draco said coldly. “Like you did me a
//__favor.__”

// 4692
//Harry nodded, blowing Draco’s mind completely, and said, “What if Lucius comes
//up with the same idea I did, that the problem is stronger wizards having fewer
//children? He might start a program to pay the strongest purebloods to have more
//children. In fact, if blood purism __were__ right, that’s just what Lucius
//__should__ be doing - addressing the problem on __his__ side, where
//he can make things happen right away. Right now, Draco, you’re the only friend
//Lucius has who would try to stop him from wasting the effort, because you’re
//the only one who knows the __real__ truth and can predict the real
//results.”

// 4693
//The thought came to Draco that Harry Potter had been raised in a place so
//strange that he was now effectively a magical creature rather than a wizard.
//Draco simply couldn’t guess what Harry would say or do next.

// 4694
//“__Why?__” Draco said. Putting pain and betrayal into his voice wasn’t
//hard at all. “Why did you __do__ this to me? What __was__ your plan?”

// 4695
//“Well,” Harry said, “you’re Lucius’s heir, and believe it or not, Dumbledore
//thinks I belong to him. So we could grow up and fight their battles with each
//other. Or we could do something else.”

// 4696
//Slowly, Draco’s mind wrapped around this. “You want to provoke a fight to the
//finish between them, then seize power after they’re both exhausted.” Draco felt
//cold dread in his chest. He would __have__ to try and stop that no matter
//the cost to himself -

// 4697
//But Harry shook his head. “Stars above, __no!__”

// 4698
//“No…?”

// 4699
//“You wouldn’t go along with that and neither would I,” said Harry. “This is
//__our__ world, we don’t want to break it. But imagine, say, Lucius thought
//the Conspiracy was your tool and you were on his side, Dumbledore thought the
//Conspiracy was my tool and I was on his side, Lucius thought that you’d turned
//me and Dumbledore believed the Conspiracy was mine, Dumbledore thought that I’d
//turned you and Lucius believed the Conspiracy was yours, and so they both
//helped us out but only in ways that the other one wouldn’t notice.”

// 4700
//Draco did not have to fake being speechless.

// 4701
//Father had once taken him to see a play called __The Tragedy of Light__,
//about this __incredibly__ clever Slytherin named Light who’d set out to
//purify the world of evil using an ancient ring that could kill anyone whose
//name and face he knew, and who’d been opposed by another incredibly clever
//Slytherin, a villain named Lawliet, who’d worn a disguise to conceal his true
//face; and Draco had shouted and cheered at all the right parts, especially in
//the middle; and then the play had ended sadly and Draco had been hugely
//disappointed and Father had gently pointed out that the word ‘Tragedy’ was
//right there in the title.

// 4702
//Afterward, Father had asked Draco if he understood why they had gone to see
//this play.

// 4703
//Draco had said it was to teach him to be as cunning as Light and Lawliet when
//he grew up.

// 4704
//Father had said that Draco couldn’t possibly be more wrong, and pointed out
//that while Lawliet had cleverly concealed his face there had been no good
//reason for him to tell Light his __name__. Father had then gone on to
//demolish almost every part of the play, while Draco listened with his eyes
//growing wider and wider. And Father had finished by saying that plays like this
//were __always__ unrealistic, because if the playwright had known what
//someone __actually__ as smart as Light would __actually__ do, the
//playwright would have tried to take over the world himself instead of just
//writing plays about it.

// 4705
//That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three, which was that any
//plot which required more than three different things to happen would never work
//in real life.

// 4706
//Father had __further__ explained that since only a fool would attempt a
//plot that was __as complicated as possible__, the real limit was two.

// 4707
//Draco couldn’t even find words to describe the sheer gargantuan unworkability
//of Harry’s master plan.

// 4708
//But it was __just__ the sort of mistake you would make if you didn’t have
//any mentors and thought you were clever and had learned about plotting by
//watching plays.

// 4709
//“So,” said Harry, “what do you think of the plan?”

// 4710
//“It’s clever…” Draco said slowly. Shouting __brilliant!__ and gasping in
//awe would have looked too suspicious. “Harry, can I ask a question?”

// 4711
//“Sure,” said Harry.

// 4712
//“Why did you buy Granger an expensive pouch?”

// 4713
//“To show no hard feelings,” said Harry at once. “Though I expect she’ll also
//feel awkward if she refuses any small requests I make over the next couple of
//months.”

// 4714
//And that was when Draco realized that Harry actually __was__ trying to be
//his friend.

// 4715
//Harry’s move against Granger __had__ been smart, maybe even brilliant.
//Make your enemy not suspect you, __and__ put them into your debt in a
//friendly way so that you could maneuver them into position __just by
//asking them__. Draco couldn’t have gotten away with that, his target would have
//been too suspicious, but the Boy-Who-Lived __could.__ So the first step of
//Harry’s plot was to give his enemy an expensive present, Draco wouldn’t have
//thought of that, but it could __work…______

// 4716
//____

// 4717
//If you were Harry’s enemy, his plots might be hard to see through at first,
//they might even be stupid, but his reasoning would make __sense__ once you
//understood it, you would comprehend that he was trying to hurt you.

// 4718
//The way Harry was acting toward Draco right now did __not__ make sense.

// 4719
//Because if you were Harry’s __friend,__ then he tried to be friends with
//you in the alien, incomprehensible way he’d been raised by Muggles to do, even
//if it meant destroying your entire life.

// 4720
//The silence stretched.

// 4721
//“I know that I’ve abused our friendship terribly,” Harry said finally. “But
//please realize, Draco, that in the end, I just wanted the two of us to find the
//truth together. Is that something you can forgive?”

// 4722
//A fork with two paths, but with only one path easy to go back on later if Draco
//changed his mind…

// 4723
//“I guess I understand what you were trying to do,” Draco lied, “so yes.”

// 4724
//Harry’s eyes lit up. “I’m glad to hear that, Draco,” he said softly.

// 4725
//The two students stood in that alcove, Harry still dipped in the lone sunbeam,
//Draco in shadow.

// 4726
//And Draco realized with a note of horror and despair, that although it was a
//terrifying fate indeed to be Harry’s friend, Harry now had so many different
//avenues for threatening Draco that being his enemy would be even
//__worse__.

// 4727
//Probably.

// 4728
//Maybe.

// 4729
//Well, he could always switch to being enemies later…

// 4730
//He was doomed.

// 4731
//“So,” Draco said. “Now what?”

// 4732
//“We study again next Saturday?”

// 4733
//“It better not go like the last one -”

// 4734
//“Don’t worry, it won’t,” said Harry. “A few more Saturdays like __that
//__and you’d be ahead of __me.__”

// 4735
//Harry laughed. Draco didn’t.

// 4736
//“Oh, and before you go,” Harry said, and grinned sheepishly. “I know this is a
//bad time, but I wanted to ask you for advice about something, actually.”

// 4737
//“Okay,” Draco said, still a bit distracted by that last statement.

// 4738
//Harry’s eyes grew intent. “Buying that pouch for Granger used up most of the
//gold I managed to steal from my Gringotts vault -”

// 4739
//What.

// 4740
//“- and McGonagall has the vault key, or Dumbledore does now, maybe. And I was
//just about to launch a plot that might take some money, so I was wondering if
//you know how I can get access -”

// 4741
//“I’ll loan you the money,” said Draco’s mouth in sheer existential reflex.

// 4742
//Harry looked taken aback, but in a pleased way. “Draco, you don’t have to -”

// 4743
//“How much?”

// 4744
//Harry named the amount and Draco couldn’t quite keep the shock from showing on
//his face. That was almost all the spending money Father had given Draco to last
//out the whole year, Draco would be left with just a few Galleons -

// 4745
//Then Draco mentally kicked himself. All he had to do was write Father and
//explain that the money was gone because he had managed to __loan it to
//Harry Potter,__ and Father would send him a special congratulatory note written
//in golden ink, a giant Chocolate Frog that would take two weeks to eat, and ten
//times as many Galleons just in case Harry Potter needed another loan.

// 4746
//“It’s way too much, isn’t it,” said Harry. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked
//-”

// 4747
//“Excuse me, I __am__ a Malfoy, you know,” said Draco. “I was just
//surprised you __wanted__ that much.”

// 4748
//“Don’t worry,” Harry Potter said cheerfully. “It’s nothing that threatens your
//family’s interests, just me being evil.”

// 4749
//Draco nodded. “No problem, then. You want to go get it right now?”

// 4750
//“Sure,” said Harry.

// 4751
//As they left the alcove and started heading toward the dungeons, Draco couldn’t
//help but ask, “So __can__ you tell me which plot this is for?”

// 4752
//“Rita Skeeter.”

// 4753
//Draco thought some very bad words to himself, but it was far too late to say
//no.

// 4754
//By the time they’d reached the dungeons, Draco had started pulling together his
//thoughts again.

// 4755
//He __was__ having trouble hating Harry Potter. Harry __had__ been
//trying to be friendly, he was just insane.

// 4756
//And that wasn’t going to stop Draco’s revenge or even slow it down.

// 4757
//“So,” Draco said, after looking around to make certain no one was nearby. Their
//voices would both be Blurred, of course, but it never hurt to be extra sure.
//“I’ve been thinking. When we bring new recruits into the Conspiracy, they’re
//going to have to __think__ we’re equals. Otherwise it would only take
//__one__ of them to blow the plot to Father. You already worked that out,
//right?”

// 4758
//“Naturally,” said Harry.

// 4759
//“__Will__ we be equals?” said Draco.

// 4760
//“I’m afraid not,” Harry said. It was clear that he was trying to sound gentle,
//and also clear that he was trying to suppress a good deal of condescension and
//not quite succeeding. “I’m sorry, Draco, but you don’t even know what the word
//__Bayesian__ in __Bayesian Conspiracy__ means right now. You’re going
//to have to study for months before we take anyone else in, just so you can put
//up a __good front__.”

// 4761
//“Because I don’t know enough science,” Draco said, carefully keeping his voice
//neutral.

// 4762
//Harry shook his head at that. “The problem isn’t that you’re ignorant of
//specific science things like deoxyribonucleic acid. __That __wouldn’t stop
//you from being my equal. The problem is that you aren’t trained in the methods
//of rationality, the __deeper__ secret knowledge behind how all those
//discoveries got made in the first place. I’ll __try__ to teach you those,
//but they’re a lot harder to learn. Think of what we did yesterday, Draco. Yes,
//you did some of the work. But I was the only one in control. You answered some
//of the questions. I asked all of them. You helped push. I did the steering by
//myself. And without the methods of rationality, Draco, you can’t possibly steer
//the Conspiracy where it needs to go.”

// 4763
//“I see,” said Draco, his voice sounding disappointed.

// 4764
//Harry’s voice tried to gentle itself even more. “I’ll try to respect your
//expertise, Draco, about things like people stuff. But you need to respect my
//expertise too, and there’s just no __way__ you could be my equal when it
//comes to steering the Conspiracy. You’ve only been a scientist for __one
//day__, you know __one__ secret about deoxyribonucleic acid, and you aren’t
//trained in __any__ of the methods of rationality.”

// 4765
//“I understand,” said Draco.

// 4766
//And he did.

// 4767
//__People stuff,__ Harry had said. Seizing control of the Conspiracy
//probably wouldn’t even be difficult. And afterward, he would kill Harry Potter
//just to be sure -

// 4768
//The memory rose up in Draco of how sick inside it had felt last night, knowing
//Harry was screaming.

// 4769
//Draco thought some more bad words.

// 4770
//Fine. He __wouldn’t__ kill Harry. Harry had been raised by Muggles, it
//wasn’t his fault he was insane.

// 4771
//Instead, Harry would live on, just so that Draco could tell him that it had all
//been for Harry’s own good, really, he ought to be grateful -

// 4772
//And with a sudden twitch of surprised pleasure, Draco realized that it actually
//__was__ for Harry’s own good. If Harry tried to carry out his plan of
//playing Dumbledore and Father for fools, he would __die.__

// 4773
//That made it __perfect.__

// 4774
//Draco would take all of Harry’s dreams away from him, just as Harry had done to
//him.

// 4775
//Draco would tell Harry that it had been for his own good, and it would be
//absolutely true.

// 4776
//Draco would wield the Conspiracy and the power of science to purify the
//wizarding world, and Father would be as proud of him as if he’d been a Death
//Eater.

// 4777
//Harry Potter’s evil plots would be foiled, and the forces of right would
//prevail.

// 4778
//The perfect revenge.

// 4779
//Unless…

// 4780
//__Just pretend to be pretending to be a scientist,__ Harry had told him.

// 4781
//Draco didn’t have words to describe exactly what was wrong with Harry’s mind -

// 4782
//(since Draco had never heard the term __depth of recursion__)

// 4783
//- but he could guess what sort of plots it implied.

// 4784
//…unless all that was exactly what Harry __wanted__ Draco to do as part of
//some even __larger__ plot which Draco would play __right into__ by
//trying to foil this one, Harry might even __know__ that his plan was
//unworkable, it might have no purpose __except__ luring Draco to thwart it
//-

// 4785
//No. That way lay __madness.__ There __had __to be a limit. The Dark
//Lord himself hadn’t been __that__ twisty. That sort of thing didn’t happen
//in real life, only in Father’s silly bedtime stories about foolish gargoyles
//who always ended up furthering the hero’s plans every time they tried to stop
//him.

// 4786
//And beside Draco, Harry walked along with a smile on his face, thinking about
//the evolutionary origins of human intelligence.

// 4787
//In the beginning, before people had quite understood how evolution worked,
//they’d gone around thinking crazy ideas like __human intelligence evolved
//so that we could invent better tools.__

// 4788
//The reason why this was crazy was that only one person in the tribe had to
//invent a tool, and then everyone else would use it, and it would spread to
//other tribes, and still be used by their descendants a hundred years later.
//That was great from the perspective of scientific progress, but in evolutionary
//terms, it meant that the person who invented something didn’t have much of a
//fitness __advantage__, didn’t have all that many __more__ children
//than everyone else. Only __relative__ fitness advantages could increase
//the relative frequency of a gene in the population, and drive some lonely
//mutation to the point where it was universal and everyone had it. And brilliant
//inventions just weren’t common enough to provide the sort of consistent
//selection pressure it took to promote a mutation. It was a natural guess, if
//you looked at humans with their guns and tanks and nuclear weapons and compared
//them to chimpanzees, that the intelligence was there to make the technology. A
//natural guess, but wrong.

// 4789
//Before people had quite understood how evolution worked, they’d gone around
//thinking crazy ideas like __the climate changed, and tribes had to
//migrate, and people had to become smarter in order to solve all the novel
//problems.__

// 4790
//But human beings had four times the brain size of a chimpanzee. 20// of a
//human’s metabolic energy went into feeding the brain. Humans were
//__ridiculously__ smarter than any other species. That sort of thing didn’t
//happen because the environment stepped up the difficulty of its problems a
//little. Then the organisms would just get a little smarter to solve them.
//Ending up with that gigantic outsized brain must have taken some sort of
//__runaway__ evolutionary process, something that would push and push
//without limits.

// 4791
//And today’s scientists had a pretty good guess at what that runaway
//evolutionary process had been.

// 4792
//Harry had once read a famous book called __Chimpanzee Politics.__ The book
//had described how an adult chimpanzee named Luit had confronted the aging
//alpha, Yeroen, with the help of a young, recently matured chimpanzee named
//Nikkie. Nikkie had not intervened directly in the fights between Luit and
//Yeroen, but had prevented Yeroen’s other supporters in the tribe from coming to
//his aid, distracting them whenever a confrontation developed between Luit and
//Yeroen. And in time Luit had won, and become the new alpha, with Nikkie as the
//second most powerful…

// 4793
//…though it hadn’t taken very long after that for Nikkie to form an alliance
//with the defeated Yeroen, overthrow Luit, and become the __new__ new
//alpha.

// 4794
//It really made you appreciate what millions of years of hominids trying to
//outwit __each other__ - an evolutionary arms race without limit - had led
//to in the way of increased mental capacity.

// 4795
//‘Cause, y’know, a human would have totally seen that one coming.

// 4796
//And beside Harry, Draco walked along, suppressing his smile as he thought about
//his revenge.

// 4797
//Someday, maybe in years but someday, Harry Potter would learn just what it
//meant to underestimate a Malfoy.

// 4798
//Draco had awakened as a scientist in a single day. Harry had said that wasn’t
//supposed to happen for months.

// 4799
//But of course if you were a Malfoy, you would be a more powerful scientist than
//anyone who wasn’t.

// 4800
//So Draco would learn all of Harry Potter’s methods of rationality, and then
//when the time was ripe -
